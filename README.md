## Hi there 👋

I'm **June Leoman Lapera**, a Front-End Developer specializing in building responsive web applications using modern frameworks. I focus on optimizing user experiences and delivering high-quality solutions.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects at **Simple Media**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, NextJS, and Sanity CMS.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the “Inspect Element” feature in web browsers was initially developed as a secret tool for internal use by developers? Now, it’s an essential tool for front-end developers to debug and refine their web applications in real-time!
